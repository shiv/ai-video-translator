# Project Overview

## 🎯 Purpose and Main Functionality

The **AI Video Translation Service** is a comprehensive web application that automatically translates spoken content in videos from one language to another. The service combines multiple AI models to create a seamless dubbing experience that preserves the original video's timing, speaker characteristics, and visual content while replacing the audio with translated speech.

### Core Capabilities

- **Automatic Video Translation**: Upload an MP4 video and receive a fully dubbed version in your target language
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports 10+ major languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Mandarin), and Hindi
- **Speaker Preservation**: Maintains speaker identity and gender characteristics in the translated audio
- **Real-time Processing**: Async job processing with live progress updates via WebSocket
- **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive frontend with drag-and-drop file upload
- **Job Management**: Persistent job tracking, status monitoring, and result download

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The application follows a **microservices-inspired architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

## 🎬 Translation Process Overview

The service implements a sophisticated **7-stage translation pipeline**:

### Stage 1: Preprocessing
- Video/audio separation using FFmpeg
- Speaker diarization with PyAnnote
- Audio segmentation by speaker and timing

### Stage 2: Speech Recognition
- Whisper-based speech-to-text conversion
- Language detection (if source language not specified)
- Gender classification for voice matching

### Stage 3: Translation
- NLLB model for text translation
- Context-aware translation preserving meaning
- Support for 200+ language pairs

### Stage 4: Voice Assignment
- Speaker-to-voice mapping based on gender
- Voice selection from available TTS voices
- Consistency maintenance across segments

### Stage 5: Text-to-Speech
- MMS model for natural speech synthesis
- Timing preservation for lip-sync compatibility
- Quality optimization for target language

### Stage 6: Audio Processing
- Dubbed audio track creation
- Volume normalization and quality enhancement
- Seamless audio segment combination

### Stage 7: Final Assembly
- Video and dubbed audio recombination
- Format optimization and compression
- Quality validation and output generation
